**A collaborative intranet for collectives to manage internal documentations, processes, courses, with various formats supported (text, images, embedded videos, ...).**

This web application is implemented with Laravel, Livewire, AlpineJS and TailwindCSS (the TALL stack).  
The development is really at the starting point, and I'm learning the frameworks and testing in parallel of this development...
